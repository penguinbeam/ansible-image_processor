# avconv_makemovie.sh version 2.8 - written by Claude Pageau.
# To install/update avconv execute the following command in RPI terminal session
#
# sudo apt-get install libav-tools
#
# Mounting a network share to /home/pi/pi-timolo/mnt folder
# Note change the IP and sharename path below to suit your network
# You can mount the network share by adding
# the appropriate entry to the /etc/fstab
# example
#
# sudo nano /etc/fstab
#
# Add a similar line below to the fstab.
# This example mounts an external Hard Drive share
# on a RPI running openelec xbmc.
# Change the IP address, share name and paths appropriately (exclude the #)
#
# //192.168.1.154/sharename/Media/Images /home/pi/pi-timolo/mnt cifs username=root,password=openelec,uid=pi,gid=pi, 0 0

# Add a crontab entry to the root crontab per the below.
# make sure makedailymovie.sh is executable eg sudo chmod +x makedailymovie.sh
#
# sudo crontab -e
#
